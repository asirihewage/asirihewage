##  My Story
Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a Pentium 4 computer, with a big CRT monitor, making a Singlish-to-Sinhala language converter for the very first time. My father offered me a desktop computer when I was in grade 6. I went through VB6 tutorials using the dongle offered by Dialog Axiata PLC for winning the Ideamart competition. It was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing some commands.

Throughout high school, me and my friend came up with some ideas for Arduino projects, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a remote control car connected through a serial cable, with dozens of projects in between. I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, then VB and C#, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my education at SLIIT. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new programming languages, ML algorithms, cloud computing, CI/CD pipelines, version control systems, project management systems and all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. I apply my experience to do something different. I started my career as a tuition master for international school children and I decided to help people as a freelancer. I have done more than 20 projects for different local and foreign customers. Then few years later, became an intern at Pearson Lanka for an extended internship up to 1yr. Working at Pearson was the greatest experience in my life. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build.
