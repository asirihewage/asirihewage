üëã Hello there! As a young boy, I was captivated by the allure of software development. My first rendezvous with coding began on a Pentium 4, crafting a Singlish-to-Sinhala converter. A gift from my father in grade 6, this machine became my playground. Fueled by Dialog Axiata PLC's Ideamart competition, I plunged into the world of VB6.

High school was a whirlwind of innovation. Alongside my buddy, we ventured from basic "Hello World" to crafting remote-controlled cars via serial cables. My appetite for knowledge grew, and I dived into HTML, CSS, Javascript, VB, C#, and any software-related literature I could grasp.

SLIIT wasn't just an educational institution for me; it was a treasure trove. The more I delved into programming languages, cloud computing, CI/CD pipelines, and more, the more I realized the vast expanse of the tech universe.

Fast forward, the industry saw me wear multiple hats. From an educator for international school kids to a freelancer, my journey was diverse. With over 20 projects under my belt and a rewarding internship at Pearson Lanka, I continued to quench my tech thirst.

Today, as a Software Engineer at Pearson - a global educational giant, I've contributed significantly to the Higher-Ed Console application and championed DevOps best practices. My stint in startups enriched my experience, allowing direct interactions with CEOs and clients, and leading automation projects.

Beyond work, I'm an adventurer at heart. üåç Traveling, cycling through nature's beauty, or immersing in oil painting, life's a vibrant canvas for me.
